# Recycling-World
This was my first project in my first year Computer Science Course with the theme of Environment and was coded in processing.
This is a game fully written in processing which implements a code that will be based on the sustainable environment theme.
This is a simple game where the player needs to sort items into the correct recycling bins by dragging and dropping them.
These items can include paper, plastic, glass, and organic waste. 
My code will allow a drag and drop function which will allow players to click items and drag them to the appropriate bin. 
The main challenge will be to catch the glass specifically which is an image and be able to sort it accordingly within the time limit.
The game speed will be dependent on player levels and amount of glass bottles caught. 
The player earns points for correctly sorting the glass items within a time limit, and the game ends when the time runs out. 
The game strategy could be made more difficult by making the time limit lower and increasing the speed of the falling items so that players would have to think harder and faster.
